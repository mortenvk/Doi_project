# Doi_project
Final project Doi

How it works:
- Go to the init file and change the db connection to your own.
- Go to the getaway folder in the project and open your database.
- run the command \i schema_ins.sql this will load all the data that we have simulated into your database
- go back to the project folder and run the command python3 run.py
- now you should be able to access our project site on localhost (or the link provided in the terminal)
- have a look around :-) you could try to sign up and see your recommended destinations...
