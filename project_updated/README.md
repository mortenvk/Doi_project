# Doi_project
Final project Doi

How it works:
- Go to the __init__.py file in the getaway folder and change the db connection to your own. 
- In the terminal, navigate to the getaway folder in the project and open your database.
- Run the command \i schema_ins.sql this will load all the data that we have simulated into your database
- Go back to the project folder and run the command python3 run.py
- Now you should be able to access our project site on localhost (the link provided in the terminal)
- Have a look around :-) you could try to sign up and see your recommended destinations...
